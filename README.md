# Saarani-frontend( CalIIITA)
The frontend for the common schedule app of IIITA, Caliiita.

College schedules get pretty overwhelming for freshers, also, not forgetting our lost minded batch mates. We often find ourselves missing the performances of our favourite bands during fests or some of the society orientations because the 'gentle reminders' come a little too late. 
But worry not, for we have the solution to this problem, the CalIIITA app! CalIIITA is a scheduling app that keeps track of all the events that happen in IIITA and helps you manage your time effectively!

Download the app from Google Play Store <a href = "https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.geekhaven.caliiita">here</a>

# Features
* A common calendar where you can track all the upcoming events

* Mark yourself as going/interested for an event which can then be tracked even more easily right from your profile.
* Societies can add all event related information, including attachments right into the event page.
* Ability to follow only particular societies so you donâ€™t get bothered with notifications of other societies.
* See upcoming events of a particular society.
